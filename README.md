# NYC_Bike_Counts_Retrospective_Analysis

I perform a retrospective analysis on the linear regression analysis that I previously performed on the NYC Bike Counts dataset. Specifically, I analyze my linear regression analysis to identify anything that I could have done differently.

## Steps

1. Choose one of the following questions (which concern what affects the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge):

    * Does the amount of precipitation affect the number of bike trips across the Brooklyn Bridge?

    * Does a high temperature affect the number of bike trips across the Brooklyn Bridge?

2. Formulated a null and an alternative hypothesis for my chosen question.

3. Used the steps that youâ€™ve learned to guide you in performing qualitative and quantitative analyses.

4. Used my knowledge of linear regression models to test the null hypothesis.

5. Identified whether I reject the null hypothesis and provided a short summary.
